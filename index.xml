      <description>Python and R Working Together R and Python are used for Data Science, but there’s certainly pros and cons for both systems. For R, it doesn’t require as much computer systems sophistication as Python. You can do simple data analyses in R fairly quickly. There’s also a lot of packages in R that use simple universal language to explore these packages. However, Python has better software for neural nets, utilizes better scale/pipelines, is faster, and much more.</description>
